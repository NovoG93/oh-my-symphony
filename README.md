Symphony turns a Kanban board into a queue of work for AI coding agents. Each
ticket runs in its own `git worktree` with the agent you pick (Codex, Claude
Code, Gemini, AGY/Antigravity, Kiro, OpenCode, Pi, or Prime Agent), and you
watch progress in a terminal TUI or a local web board on port 9999. Tickets
are Markdown files in your repo by default; Linear and Jira also work.

Forked from [OpenAI's Symphony reference implementation](https://github.com/openai/symphony).
Full details: **[docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md)**.

## Install

Requires Python 3.12+ and Git. Symphony is not on PyPI yet; install from this
checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskwork/oh-my-symphony.git
cd oh-my-symphony
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
```

Then put at least one agent CLI on `$PATH`:

| `agent.kind` | CLI | Install / sign-in |
|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| `codex` | `codex` | needs the `app-server` subcommand |
| `claude` | `claude` | Claude Code |
| `gemini` | `gemini` | Gemini CLI |
| `agy` | `agy` | Google Antigravity |
| `kiro` | `kiro-cli` | `kiro-cli login` or `KIRO_API_KEY` |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | `npm install -g opencode-ai`, `opencode auth login` |
| `pi` | `pi` | `npm i -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, then `/login` |
| `prime-agent` | `prime-agent` | Prime Agent installer, then `/login` or a provider API key |

Exact install commands are in the [reference](docs/reference.md#install-and-agent-clis).

## 5-minute quickstart

**Do not run tickets inside the `oh-my-symphony` checkout.** Doctor and
startup refuse a `WORKFLOW.md` in Symphony's own repository so agents cannot
edit the orchestrator. Create or register a separate project instead.

**1. Create or register a project.** This writes `WORKFLOW.md`, a `kanban/`
board, stage prompts, skills, and `AGENTS.md`.

```bash
symphony project create "My App" --path ../my-app
# or adopt an existing directory (Git and missing files are added safely)
symphony project add /path/to/existing-project --name "My App"
cd ../my-app
```

For a bare directory with your own `WORKFLOW.md`, run `symphony board init ./kanban`.

**2. Pick the agent.** Set `agent.kind` in `WORKFLOW.md`, for example
`kind: claude`.

**3. Check the setup.**

```bash
symphony doctor ./WORKFLOW.md      # every line should read PASS
```

Exit code `0` means all checks passed, `1` means a FAIL, `2` means
`WORKFLOW.md` could not be loaded.

**4. Add a ticket.**

```bash
symphony board new TASK-1 "Fix flaky pagination test" \
  --priority 2 --description "tests/test_pagination.py is flaky on CI."
```

**5. Run it.** Use the terminal TUI or the web board:

```bash
symphony tui ./WORKFLOW.md                        # needs an interactive terminal
symphony service start ./WORKFLOW.md --port 9999  # background service
# open http://127.0.0.1:9999/
```

Within one poll tick (30 s by default) the card shows a green ● with turn
count and tokens. When the agent finishes, it sets `state: Done` in
`kanban/TASK-1.md` and appends a `## Resolution` section; that edit moves the
card. If the port is busy, `symphony tui` reports which process holds it.

> **The default hook attaches each ticket workspace as a `git worktree` on a
> `symphony/<ID>` branch.** With `agent.auto_merge_on_done` enabled the
> orchestrator merges once at Done; do not merge that branch by hand as well.

**No agent CLI yet?** The bundled mock backend moves cards without calling an
LLM. See [Mock demo](docs/reference.md#mock-demo-no-agent-cli-required).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `symphony project create\|add\|list\|start\|stop\|status\|remove` | Register and run independent project services |
| `symphony hub` | Multi-project hub (default `127.0.0.1:8787`) |
| `symphony doctor [WORKFLOW]` | Preflight checks for `WORKFLOW.md` |
| `symphony board init\|ls\|new\|mv\|update\|show\|graph` | Validated file-board ticket tool |
| `symphony tui [WORKFLOW]` | Orchestrator + terminal Kanban TUI |
| `symphony [WORKFLOW]` | Orchestrator headless, with web board and `WORKFLOW-PROGRESS.md` |
| `symphony service start\|stop\|restart\|status\|logs` | Managed background orchestrator |
| `symphony runs [WORKFLOW]` | Recent run attempts |
| `symphony factory init\|sync\|start` | Autonomous development factory |
| `symphony pm demo` | Disposable PM Workspace demo |
| `symphony release check` | Validate app release evidence |

Useful flags: `--port`, `--host`, `--tui`, `--no-progress-md`,
`--no-keep-awake`, `--log-level`. Logs go to stderr only; redirect with
`2>> log/symphony.log`.

## Features

**Agent backends.** Set a global `agent.kind`, pin one per ticket with
`agent_kind: codex` in ticket frontmatter (or `board new --agent-kind`), route
per lane with `agent.stage_kinds`, and fail over with `agent.fallback_kinds`.
See [Agent backends](docs/reference.md#agent-backends).

**Trackers.** File board by default (`tracker.kind: file`). Linear:
[`WORKFLOW.example.md`](WORKFLOW.example.md). Jira:
[`examples/WORKFLOW.jira.example.md`](examples/WORKFLOW.jira.example.md).
Browser editing is file-board only; Linear/Jira boards are read-only status.
See [Trackers](docs/reference.md#trackers-file-linear-jira).

**Web board and TUI.** Projects, board CRUD and drag-and-drop, workflow and
prompt editing, Git review and merge, operator chat, product preview, runs,
stats, and settings at `http://127.0.0.1:9999/`. The TUI covers ticket
create/edit, pause/resume, skip Document, filter, and stats (`?` lists keys).
Before exposing the board through a proxy or tunnel, read
[Reverse proxy, tunnels, and API token](docs/reference.md#reverse-proxy-tunnels-and-api-token).

**Autonomous development factory.** A Wayfinder -> Symphony -> Supergoal loop
with a `Ready -> Build -> Verify -> Done` board:

```bash
git init my-product && cd my-product
symphony factory init . --agent opencode
git add . && git commit -m "Initialize Symphony factory"
# create Wayfinder tickets under wayfinder/tickets/, then:
symphony factory start ./wayfinder
```

Browser gates need extra runtimes (Node.js, Playwright). See
[Autonomous development factory](docs/reference.md#autonomous-development-factory)
and the [factory guide](skills/symphony-skill/reference/factory.md).

**PM Workspace.** Plan a change (idea, requirements, design, plan) and hand
it off as board tickets. Try `symphony pm demo` (or `--lang ko`); it needs Git
and Node.js 20.19.0+. See [docs/pm-workspace.md](docs/pm-workspace.md).

**Lane presets.** `default` (Todo, In Progress, Verify, Document) or `deep`
(eight lanes from Intake to Document), switchable in Settings. See
[Lane presets](docs/reference.md#lane-presets-and-stage-contracts) and
[docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md).

**Also included:** chat intake with one approval gate, opt-in app release
contracts, experimental continuous improvement, Slack notifications, English
and Korean UI (`tui.language` / `SYMPHONY_LANG`), and macOS keep-awake.
Windows needs Git Bash; see [Platforms](docs/reference.md#platforms).
