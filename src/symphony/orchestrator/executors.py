"""The seam between "which ticket runs" and "how that ticket runs".

`Orchestrator` keeps every responsibility it already had: polling trackers,
deciding eligibility, acquiring the dispatch lease, creating and cleaning
workspaces, enforcing global concurrency, publishing snapshots, and
applying terminal policy. What it delegates through this Protocol is only
the shape of the work *inside* one ticket run.

`LegacyStageExecutor` is the one implementation — stage prompts,
agent-authored board transitions, the multi-turn loop in
`core._run_agent_attempt`. It delegates rather than duplicating, so the
seam moves no legacy code and cannot regress it.

Selection happens once per dispatch, before the worker task is created, so
a run's execution mode is fixed for its whole lifetime.
